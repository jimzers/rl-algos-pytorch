# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms, Implemented in Pytorch

Hey there! This repository holds some reinforcement learning algorithms that I will be implementing in Pytorch. Some examples of things I will implement:

1. Basic Policy Gradient
2. A2C [https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783]
3. PPO [https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347]
4. SAC [https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290]
